#    When I login as an object manager
#    And I click on the button "create order"
#    And I enter "str" into the search box
#    And I choose an apartment from the list
#    And I enter <rooms> as the number of rooms
#    And I enter <bathroom> as the bathroom area
#    And I enter <kitchen> as the kitchen area
#    Then I expect the configurator button to be in the state "<state>"
#    When I click on the button "Complete configuration"
#    Then I am redirected to the page "<page>"
